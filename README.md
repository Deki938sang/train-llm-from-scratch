## Introduction üìñ
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the field of natural language processing. They have revolutionized various applications such as text generation, translation, and summarization. In this repository, we provide a step-by-step guide on training your LLM from scratch. Whether you want to work with the GPT series from OpenAI or other transformer models, this repository will equip you with the necessary knowledge and resources.

## Features ‚ú®
- Detailed instructions on downloading and preprocessing data for training your LLM.
- Step-by-step guide on training the model using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Tips and best practices for fine-tuning your LLM based on the specific task or dataset.
- Evaluation metrics and techniques to assess the performance of your trained model.
- Sample code snippets and examples to facilitate learning and implementation.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To get started with training your LLM from scratch, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/train-llm-from-scratch.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the pre-processed dataset from the following link: [Download Dataset](#needs_to_be_launched)

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to reach out to the community for support.

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
Once you have set up the repository and downloaded the dataset, you can start training your LLM by following these steps:
1. Run the data preprocessing script to format the dataset for training.
2. Choose the appropriate hyperparameters and configuration settings for your LLM.
3. Initiate the training process and monitor the model's progress.
4. Evaluate the model performance using relevant metrics.
5. Generate text samples to witness the capabilities of your trained LLM.

For a more detailed guide on each step, refer to the documentation provided in the repository.
