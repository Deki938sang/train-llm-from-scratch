## Introduction 📖
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the field of natural language processing. They have revolutionized various applications such as text generation, translation, and summarization. In this repository, we provide a step-by-step guide on training your LLM from scratch. Whether you want to work with the GPT series from OpenAI or other transformer models, this repository will equip you with the necessary knowledge and resources.

## Features ✨
- Detailed instructions on downloading and preprocessing data for training your LLM.
- Step-by-step guide on training the model using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Tips and best practices for fine-tuning your LLM based on the specific task or dataset.
- Evaluation metrics and techniques to assess the performance of your trained model.
- Sample code snippets and examples to facilitate learning and implementation.
